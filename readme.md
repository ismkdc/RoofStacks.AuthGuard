Project Overview

This is a sample project developed using .NET 8. It serves as an example and is not intended for production use. The project demonstrates basic API operations such as retrieving, updating, and deleting employee data. It utilizes IdentityServer4 for authentication and authorization, allowing a client application to access the API securely.

Project Structure

The solution is organized into several key components:

API Project: Simulates basic CRUD operations for employee data. The API is secured, and clients must be authorized to interact with it. Currently, the client is authorized only to retrieve data.
Client: A pre-defined client in the IdentityServer4 setup. It is configured with the necessary permissions to access the API. For now, it is authorized only to fetch employee data.
Shared: Contains common classes and utilities that are shared across different projects in the solution. This ensures reusability and consistency.
Key Features

.NET 8: The project is built on the latest .NET 8 framework, leveraging its performance improvements and new features.
IdentityServer4: Used for handling authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized clients can access the API.
JSON Source Generator: The project includes support for JSON Source Generators, which enhance performance by generating optimized code for JSON serialization and deserialization at compile-time.
HttpClientFactory: All HTTP requests in the project are handled using HttpClientFactory, which provides a centralized way to manage HTTP client instances, improving the application's scalability and reliability.
Forbidden Requests Handling: Any unauthorized attempts to access API resources are properly handled, and the user receives a 403 Forbidden response, clearly indicating that access is denied.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
.NET 8 SDK installed on your development machine.
IdentityServer4 setup and running for client authentication and authorization.
Running the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in your preferred IDE.
Restore the necessary packages by running dotnet restore.
Build the solution using dotnet build.
Run the API project and ensure IdentityServer4 is configured properly.
Use the client application to make authorized requests to the API.
Example Usage
To retrieve employee data, send a GET request from the authorized client to the /api/employee endpoint.
Ensure that the client has been granted the necessary permissions to access this endpoint.
